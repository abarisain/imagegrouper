#ImageGrouper

Image grouper is a tool that detects duplicate images and groups them by similarity.


It uses pHash, and allows you to select which algorithm you want to use (or all of them, ImageGrouper takes the average) and the minimum similarity.


##Compilation

Just "make".  

If your system comes without the -mt version of boost, run "make nomt". 

##Usage  

I'll write this someday.

The test program prints it's syntax when ran.

##Future

It will be a library and will maybe come with a gui someday, but for the moment there is only a test program that writes the result in a html file.
